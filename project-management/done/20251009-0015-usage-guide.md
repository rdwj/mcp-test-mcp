# Story 0015: Detailed usage guide and examples

## Description

Create detailed usage documentation covering common workflows, troubleshooting, and advanced use cases. This goes beyond the README to provide comprehensive guidance for developers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/usage.md` created
- [x] Complete workflow examples (connect, list, call, disconnect)
- [x] Examples for each of the 13 tools
- [x] Troubleshooting section with common issues
- [x] Error message reference with solutions
- [x] Environment variable configuration guide
- [x] Best practices for using with Claude Code
- [x] Examples of testing different server types
- [x] Tips for verbose output interpretation

## Technical Notes

**Sections to include:**
1. **Getting Started** - First connection walkthrough
2. **Testing Tools** - list_tools and call_tool examples
3. **Testing Resources** - list_resources and read_resource examples
4. **Testing Prompts** - list_prompts and get_prompt examples
5. **Connection Management** - Status checks, reconnection patterns
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common errors and solutions
7. **Configuration** - Environment variables reference
8. **Best Practices** - Tips for effective testing
9. **Advanced Use Cases** - Complex scenarios

**Example format:**
```markdown
## Testing a Deployed Server

1. Connect to the server:
   User: "Connect to https://my-server.com/mcp"
   Claude: [calls connect_to_server...]

2. List available tools:
   User: "What tools does it have?"
   Claude: [calls list_tools...]

3. Test a specific tool:
   User: "Test the add tool with 5 and 3"
   Claude: [calls call_tool...]
```

## AI Directives

**IMPORTANT**: As you work through this story, please mark checklist items as complete `[x]` as you finish them. This ensures that if we need to pause and resume work, we have a clear record of progress. Update the `status` field in the frontmatter when moving between stages (in-progress, ready-for-review, done, blocked).

Provide concrete examples that developers can copy and adapt. Include troubleshooting for common issues.

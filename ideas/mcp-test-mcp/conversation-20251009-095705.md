## How This Started

User identified a fundamental problem with MCP server development:
- Can't test MCP servers interactively like REST APIs (/docs endpoints)
- Need specialized tools (MCP Inspector, Postman, cmcp)
- **AI assistants can't help because they can't interact with MCP protocol**

## The Painful Rework Loop

User shared their experience:
> "What ends up happening is the AI assistant assumes that since none of its curl commands work that the MCP server must be broken, or the client code is all wrong. AI models have not seen enough production-grade MCP code in their training, because MCP is so new, so they assume that the code is wrong and proceed to rip it all out and try to make it work like a REST or ws api. This has caused me days of rework."

This is a real problem:
1. AI tries to curl the MCP server → fails (because MCP doesn't work that way)
2. AI assumes code is broken → "fixes" it by converting to REST/WebSocket
3. Developer loses days of work

## The Security Angle

Even if Claude could adopt new MCP servers automatically:
- Users need to run terminal commands for security
- If they don't know the MCP server works yet, they might be giving Claude something broken
- This causes cascading problems

## The Solution Vision

Build **mcp-test-mcp**: An MCP server that gives AI assistants MCP testing capabilities.

Architecture:
```
Claude Code/Desktop (MCP Client)
    ↓ stdio
mcp-test-mcp Server
    ↓ FastMCP Client internally
Target MCP Server (being tested)
```

Claude can call tools like:
- `list_tools` - See what tools the target server has
- `test_tool` - Execute tools with parameters
- `list_resources` - Check available resources
- etc.

## Project Name

Settled on: **mcp-test-mcp**
- Self-descriptive (an MCP server for testing MCP servers)
- Name is available (searched GitHub, nothing exists)

## What We Found in Research

Existing tools fall into two categories:

**UI-based (for humans):**
- MCP Inspector (official) - browser UI on ports 6274/6277
- Various Inspector forks

**Test Automation (for CI/CD):**
- test-mcp (Loadmill) - YAML test flows
- mcp-server-tester - Uses Claude to generate tests
- mcp-performance-test - Load testing
- mcp-testing-kit - Testing utilities

**The Gap:**
None of these give AI assistants the ability to test MCP servers as a native capability. This project fills that gap.

## Questions for Next Session

- What tools should we prioritize first?
- Should we support all three transports (stdio, streaming-http, SSE)?
- How do we handle authentication when testing remote servers?
- Should there be tools for monitoring/debugging (like watching logs)?
- Do we need configuration management (saving server connection details)?
